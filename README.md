# Recipe App

A Vanilla JS app to create and store recipes.

## Checklist

I hope to be able to do the following with the app:

- [ ] Be accessible. *Everyone* should be able to use it
- [ ] Add ingredients to different categories (wet, dry, mix-in)
- [ ] Add each step in the recipe
- [ ] Save via local storage
- [ ] Allow the person to enter their name so it says "{Name}'s Recipes" in the title bar/H1
- [ ] Connect to a database so users can use their recipes on any device
